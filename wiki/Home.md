# Welcome to the Airplanes Mod Wiki!
## 1.
At this time, the mod is in an extreme alpha stage. Use it with caution and/or use a different Minecraft installation folder.

The wiki is under construction, too. But we're working on it. We promise.

WHY ARE THERE NO AIRPLANES IN DAT DAMN MOD?!!!11 <br>
Well... That's because they're difficult to make! But we hired an extra modeller to make them, but this takes a really long time. The first airplane will be released in v1.0-beta, which is after a short debug release the next waypoint to be done. Actually, the 3D model of the plane is already finished, we're just coding the functions into it.
